## Problem Statement

Have you ever wanted to just find a recipe on the internet for a quick meal, but found yourself scrolling endlessly 
through a long tedious blog before finally stumbling across the ingredients and directions at the very bottom 
of the page? Well do I have a solution for you! This website allows users to search for all kinds of different recipes, 
from meals to snacks to drinks. Not sure what you are looking for? No problem, you can browse through all of our
categories. This website also allows users to sign up to save recipes to create their own personal recipe book, 
along with adding their own favorite recipes to the website.

## Potential API's

- EDAMAM (Food and recipe search API demo)
- MyCookbook.io (Parses online recipes from any website.)
- Tasty (A database of recipies combined with user data, reviews, and ratings)
