    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>We were founded by a college student named Abigail Genz who during her experience in college wanted to
        spend time with her friends and family by cooking dinners for them. She found herself spending an absurd amount of
        time just trying to find that perfect recipe to cook because of all the blog scrolling. As anyone knows college students
        don't have time to be spending more than 5 minutes looking for a recipe. That is where Foodie Grub came from.... </p>
    <p>Foodie Grub is a website that allows you to access 1,000's of recipes without having to scroll through long blogs.
